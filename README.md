# Hey there, I'm **andr515i** 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This space is mainly dedicated to my school years and serves as a hub for my personal projects and coding experiments. Please note that while you'll see several repositories here, **not all my code is public** due to security and privacy reasons. So, if it seems like my public work doesn’t tell the whole story, that’s why!

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  - Although a big number of my projects are websites (Angular, TypeScript), I actually prefer working on **anything other than websites**.
  - I'm diving into **Rust** 🦀 lately and having a blast learning it.
  - **Flutter** has become my favorite since I picked it up in 2024—its power and flexibility have won me over! 💙

- **Projects:**  
  I have a mix of school-related projects, personal explorations, and experiments. While many projects are public, some are kept private to safeguard sensitive information.

## ℹ️ A Few More Things

- **Privacy:**  
  I try to keep my projects as transparent as possible, but for security reasons, some repositories remain private.

  I'm always looking to improve my profile. If you have suggestions or need more information, just drop me a message or open an issue!

Happy coding! 😄
