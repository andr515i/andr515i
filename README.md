# Hey there, I'm **andr515i** 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This space is mainly dedicated to my school years and serves as a hub for my personal projects and coding experiments. Please note that while you'll see several repositories here, **not all my code is public** due to security and privacy reasons. So, if it seems like my public work doesn’t tell the whole story, that’s why!

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  - Although a big number of my projects are websites (Angular, TypeScript, HTML), I actually prefer working on **anything other than websites**.
  - I'm diving into **Rust** 🦀 lately and having a blast learning it.
  - **Flutter** has become my favorite since I picked it up in 2024—its power and flexibility have won me over! 💙

- **Projects:**  
  I have a mix of school-related projects, personal explorations, and experiments. While many projects are public, some are kept private to safeguard sensitive information.

## ℹ️ A Few More Things

- **Privacy:**  
  I try to keep my projects as transparent as possible, but for security reasons, some repositories remain private.

Happy coding! 😄
